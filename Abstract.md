ABSTRACT

The idea of a Smart City has been in existence from many years. One of the major challenges which needs to get rid of is Traffic Congestion. The main reason for this situation is the movement of vehicles in search of an empty parking slot. Internet of Things is a technology which can make the connectivity of surrounding environmental things possible and thus provides access to those things from any location. The proposed system comprises the use of Cloud and IoT technologies in order to provide the status of parking areas to the user from any remote location. This system reduces the unwanted roaming around the streets in search of empty parking slots. The model is implemented by using HTTP protocol which is easy to implement. A Mobile Application which is simple and well-designed is also provided such that the end user can check the status of Parking Areas without the need of checking manually.
